										<h2>Our Fraternity</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Sigma Phi Delta is an international social fraternity of engineers founded at the University of Southern California April 11, 1924. It has grown steadily over the past 90 years — reaching nearly 40 universities worldwide — and continues to expand today. It is well organized, and its chapters are carefully supervised by the international officers and by faculty and alumni advisors. Sigma Phi Delta was organized to promote the advancement of the engineering profession and of engineering education, to encourage excellence in scholarship, and to develop in its members the highest ideals of manhood, good citizenship, and brotherhood.
									<br>
									<br>
									The Beta-Iota Colony of Sigma Phi Delta was founded at the University of Maryland on February 25, 2012 and became an Active Chapter in June of the same year. Our goals and objectives follow along well with those of our international counterparts. We are frequently involved in many types of events: Professional Events, like grad panels and tours of facilities such as the Goddard Space and Flight Center; Philanthropy Events, such as our annual trip to volunteer for the KEEN Program in Washington, D.C.; and Social Events, including trips to play paint ball, laser tag, and more. We strive to continue our proud traditions and have fun along the way.</p>
