            <p>
              Sigma Phi Delta is an international social fraternity of engineers
              founded at the University of Southern California on April 11,
              1924. It has grown steadily over the past 100 years — reaching
              nearly 40 universities worldwide — and continues to expand today.
              It is well organized, and its chapters are carefully supervised by
              the international officers and by faculty and alumni advisors.
              Sigma Phi Delta was organized to promote the advancement of the
              engineering profession and of engineering education, to encourage
              excellence in scholarship, and to develop in its members the
              highest ideals of manhood, good citizenship, and brotherhood.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Beta-Iota Colony of Sigma Phi Delta was founded at the
              University of Maryland on February 25, 2012 and became an Active
              Chapter in June of the same year. Our goals and objectives follow
              along well with those of our international counterparts. We are
              frequently involved in many types of events: Professional Events,
              including graduate panels and professional events with notable
              companies such as Deloitte; Philanthropy Events, like our annual
              trip to volunteer for the KEEN Program in Washington, D.C.; and
              Social Events, including formals, away weekends, and brotherhood
              tournaments. We strive to continue our proud traditions and have
              fun along the way.
