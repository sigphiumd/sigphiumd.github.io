              Sigma Phi Delta is the only social and professional Engineering
              and Computer Science fraternity at the University of Maryland. We
              are focused on our studies but we also know how to kick back and
              have a good time. Rush Week is your best opportunity to meet the
              brothers and to find out if our culture is a good fit for you. The
              ideal rush is someone who can balance their social life with the
              workload that comes with being an engineer at UMD. We encourage
              you to stop by and see what we're about!

                  We take our majors seriously and host many academic events
                  throughout the year in order to maintain our average 3.65 GPA.
                  We understand the rigor that comes with being an Engineer, and
                  being part of our brotherhood means that you always have
                  someone to reach out to if you're falling behind in any of
                  your classes or need someone to study with.

                  Among our members, we've held a wide variety of internships
                  and full time positions across top engineering and CS
                  companies. 100% of our alumni are currently employed in a full
                  time position related to CS or engineering, or pursuing
                  graduate school. Joining Sigma Phi Delta gives you access to
                  countless connections in the industry as well as a vast range
                  of opportunities and experienced brothers that can help you
                  get that job you've always wanted. Take a look at some of the
                  places we've worked.

                  Sigma Phi Delta is both a social and professional fraternity -
                  we know how to get work done, but we also know how to have a
                  good time. Kinda like a tuxedo T-shirt, but if the tuxedo was
                  a polo oversized shirt and cargo shorts. Unlike fully
                  professional fraternities, we have our own chapter house,
                  which provides us with a great venue for brotherhood and
                  philanthropy events.
